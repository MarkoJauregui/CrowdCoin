# CrowdCoin

CrowdCoin is a dapp inspired by the famous website Kickstarter. (Has not been deployed)

Using Solidity Smart contracts, you can verify that the people getting funded are not doing irresponsible things unrelated to the project
by using a voting system in which the investors are in control of whether transactions go through or not.
